# About

I am pursuing a Master's in CS from GaTech.
Previously I have been an Applied Research Scientist at NeuralSpace.
The title might sound fancy but essentially, my work involved training the world's best STT/NLP models, and serving them to customers via production ready APIs. 

These days, I am working on a few projects! Have a look, feel free to hmu if you find it interesting, and maybe give a start if you found it valuable!
