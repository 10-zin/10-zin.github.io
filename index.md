Hello and welcome to my home in the world wide web. 

My official name is Tenzin Singhay Bhotia, but you can call me Tenzin. I usually go by the pseudonym 10zin on the net.

I wanted to create this place, to soon start posting blogs, that are basicallly a some-what organized dump of ideas and questions I am dealing with daily.

You can refer to [about](about.md) section for now to know more about me!
